> It was a cold blustery night and the rat was huddled up in his cozy little nest in the corner of the basement. He had been coding for hours, trying to perfect a new TypeScript library for Supabase, a popular database service.
> 
> As the wind howled outside, the rat's fingers flew across the keyboard, typing out lines of code with lightning speed. He was completely focused on the task at hand, completely lost in the world of programming.
> 
> Despite the late hour, the rat was determined to get his library just right. He knew that if he could get it finished, it would be a huge boon for Supabase users everywhere. They would be able to create even more powerful and efficient databases, all thanks to his hard work.
> 
> As the night wore on, the rat's eyes began to droop and his fingers slowed down. But he refused to give up. He knew that if he just kept going, he could finish the library before dawn.
> 
> Finally, with a triumphant cry, the rat completed the last line of code. He sat back in his chair, exhausted but proud of what he had achieved.
> 
> As the sun began to rise, the rat crawled back into his nest and fell into a deep, restful sleep. He knew that when he woke up, his TypeScript library would be ready to be released to the world. And with any luck, it would be embraced by Supabase users everywhere, making the cold blustery night of coding all worth it in the end.
